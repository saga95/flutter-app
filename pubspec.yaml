  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/Event_0.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_1.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_2.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_3.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_4.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_5.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_6.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_7.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_8.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_9.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_10.png
    - assets/images/Event_11.jpg
    - assets/images/Event_12.jpg
    - assets/images/wallpaper1.jpg
    - assets/images/imgc1.jpg
    - assets/images/imgc2.jpg
    - assets/images/imgc3.jpg
    - assets/images/imgc4.jpg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: CroissantOne
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/CroissantOne-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
